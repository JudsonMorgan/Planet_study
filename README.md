# Planet_study
An artificial intelligence algorithms to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use. For this Multi-class Multi-Label problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: Cloud Cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze), Primary RainForest, Water (rivers, lakes), Habitation (large city, small homes), Agriculture, Roads etc. The algorithms from this project will enable us to understand where, how and why deforestation happens.
